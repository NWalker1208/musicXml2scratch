**PLEASE NOTE: PHP VERSION ISN'T SUPPORTED**

musicXml2scratch (created by [webdesigner97](https://github.com/webdesigner97) and continued by [SzAmmi](https://github.com/SzAmmi)) converts [musicXML](http://www.musicxml.org/) files
into text files which can be imported into a [Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/61176034/)
from where they can just be played to your audience or even build a Synthesia, Guitar Hero,
whatever-like game.

This project is **stable**. Found a bug? Visit the [Issues].
