#musicXml2scratch

musicXml2scratch (created by https://github.com/webdesigner97) converts musicXML files (see http://www.musicxml.org/)
into text files which can be imported into a Scratch (see http://scratch.mit.edu) project
from where they can just be played to your audience or even build a Synthesia, Guitar Hero,
whatever-like game.

This project is **stable**. Found a bug? Visit the [Issues].
